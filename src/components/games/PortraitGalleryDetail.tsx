    q: "What are some fun ice breaker activities for an art class?",
    a: "Portrait Gallery, Blind Portraits, Pass the Portrait, and a short gallery walk all fit art class openers. Keep rounds to 10–15 seconds so skill level does not matter and everyone finishes with a playful display.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good icebreaker drawing game?",
    a: "Portrait Gallery is one of the best drawing icebreakers for mixed skill levels: subjects stay still, artists rotate every 10–15 seconds, and the final collage is intentionally imperfect and funny.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you play Portrait Gallery online or virtually?",
    a: "Yes. Use breakout rooms with one subject and several artists, or have everyone draw a partner from gallery view on paper at home. Share photos of sketches in chat, then run a virtual gallery walk by screensharing a few favorites.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many people and how long does Portrait Gallery take?",

          <h2>What is a Portrait Gallery?</h2>
          <p>
            {game.description ||
              "Portrait Gallery is a creative icebreaker where teams create quick portraits of each other by rotating artists every 10–15 seconds. The result is a set of wonderfully varied (and often messy) images you can display once the round ends."}
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike a quiet “draw your neighbor” exercise, Portrait Gallery is designed as a{" "}
            <strong>portrait gallery icebreaker game</strong>: short timed bursts, clear roles
            (subjects and artists), a loud rotate cue, and a gallery walk at the end. Drawing skill
            does not matter—speed and laughter do. That is why it works for adults at work as well as
            teens in class.
          </p>
          <h3>Why play it—and when it fails</h3>
          <p>
            It gets people moving and looking at each other without forcing personal stories. Quiet
            participants can contribute as artists. The gallery wall becomes a shared artifact you can
            reference for the rest of the day. Compared with talking-only openers, this drawing
            icebreaker lowers pressure while still creating memorable moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            It fails when the rotate call is mushy (room chaos), when people critique looks instead of
            lines, or when you treat unfinished sketches as an art critique. It also fails in rooms
            that cannot stand or pass paper. Skip it after anyone opts out of being drawn with no
            alternate role, when materials are missing, or when the next block is a high-stakes formal
            talk and you only have five minutes—use{" "}
            <Link href="/games/emoji-introduction">Emoji Introduction</Link> or jump to the agenda.

        <section className={styles.safety}>
          <h2>Facilitator notes, safety &amp; pitfalls</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Make participation optional—offer a “sitter” or timer role for anyone who does not want to be drawn</li>
            <li>Ban commentary on appearance; celebrate playful lines, not “accuracy”</li>
            <li>Use soft pencils and plenty of paper so mistakes feel cheap</li>
            <li>Keep intervals short (10–15 seconds) so perfectionism never starts</li>
            <li>For mixed-ability groups, say out loud: “Ugly drawings are the goal”</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pitfall — weak rotate cue:</strong> if artists wander, freeze, reset seats, and
              restart the next interval with a louder “Rotate!”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pitfall — too few people:</strong> under ~6, drop the subject/artist split and
              use Pass the Portrait instead
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

            <p className={styles.storyLead}>
              Call “Rotate!” on the timer. Artists move; subjects stay still. The collage builds
              itself.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.guide} id="how-to-play">
          <h2>How to play Portrait Gallery (step-by-step instructions)</h2>
          <p>
            Use this facilitator flow for an in-person group. Adjust the number of rotate rounds to
            fit your clock—most rooms need 6–10 short intervals plus a two-minute gallery walk.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Split into subjects and artists</h3>
          <p>
            Divide the group into Team A (subjects) and Team B (artists). A classic setup is an{" "}
            <strong>inner circle</strong> of subjects facing out and an <strong>outer circle</strong>{" "}
            of artists facing in—each artist starts opposite one subject. If chairs make circles hard,
            seat subjects along a table and have artists stand opposite them. Subjects should sit
            still and look roughly toward their current artist; artists hold paper and a pencil ready.
          </p>

          <h3>2. What you&apos;ll need</h3>
          <ul>
            {materialsList.map((item) => (
              <li key={item}>{item}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <p>
            One sheet per subject is enough if artists rotate and keep adding to the same portrait.
            For cleaner results, give each artist a fresh sheet per subject and collate them later.
            Tape or binder clips help when you hang the gallery on a wall or whiteboard.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Draw, rotate, repeat (10–15 second intervals)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Start the timer for 10–15 seconds and say “Draw!”</li>
            <li>Artists sketch quickly—eyes, hair, smile, posture, whatever they notice first.</li>
            <li>
              When the timer ends, call <strong>“Rotate!”</strong> Artists move one seat (or one
              person) clockwise. Subjects stay put.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repeat until every artist has contributed to every subject, or until you hit your time
              box (usually 6–10 rounds).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The rotate call is the heartbeat of the activity. Keep it consistent. If the room gets
            chaotic, freeze, reset positions, and restart the next interval. Remind people that
            unfinished lines are part of the charm.
          </p>

          <h3>4. The gallery walk reveal</h3>
          <p>
            Collect the portraits (or leave them on tables) and invite the group to stroll. Ask
            subjects to find “their” collage and notice which features different artists caught.
            Optional: each subject picks one detail they love and thanks the anonymous artists. End by
            hanging a few favorites where the group will see them during the rest of the session.
          </p>

        <section className={styles.scriptBand}>
          <h2>Facilitator script</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Open:</strong> “We’re going to make a Portrait Gallery. Half of you are
            subjects—sit still and smile if you want. Half of you are artists—you get 15 seconds to
            sketch, then I will shout Rotate and you move to the next person. Ugly drawings win. Pass
            or take the timer role if you prefer not to be drawn.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mid:</strong> “Freeze. Reset seats. Next interval starts on my Draw. Keep lines
            loose—accuracy is not the point.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Close:</strong> “Two-minute gallery walk. Find your collage, pick one detail you
            like, then we hang a few favorites and start the agenda.”
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.guide}>
          <h2>Portrait Gallery variations</h2>
          <p>
            Once the core rotate loop works, swap one rule to match your audience. These variations
            cover the most common search intents around portrait gallery activities.
          </p>

          <h3>Blind portraits</h3>
          <p>
            Artists draw without looking at the paper—eyes stay on the subject. Lines get wilder and
            the gallery becomes comedy gold. Great for energy after lunch or for groups that claim
            they “can’t draw.”
          </p>

          <h3>Pass the portrait (kids / simplified)</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone draws at once for 15 seconds, then passes the paper to the right. No standing
            circles required. Use this with elementary groups or tight classroom rows where an outer
            circle will not fit.
          </p>

          <h3>Virtual Portrait Gallery (online meetings)</h3>
          <p>
            Put one subject on camera in a breakout room; others draw from gallery view on paper or a
            tablet. After two minutes, screenshot or photo-upload sketches into chat. For larger Zoom
            groups, run two rounds of subjects, then screenshare a mosaic. Pair with other{" "}
            <Link href="/virtual-icebreaker-games">virtual ice breaker games</Link> if you need a
            full remote warm-up agenda.
          </p>

          <h3>Original variant: gallery → working wall</h3>
          <p>
            After the gallery walk, hang each portrait next to the breakout table or wall space that
            group will use for the next agenda block. Announce it up front: the messy collage becomes
            the room map, not disposable scrap. People remember faces because the art stays visible
            while they work—and you skip a second “find your table” speech.
