              Ice breaker games for meetings work when people feel free to opt out and nobody is
              set up to be embarrassed in front of their manager.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                State a pass option upfront and offer chat or written options for quieter voices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Time-box ruthlessly—meeting icebreakers lose trust when they eat the working
                agenda.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prefer work-safe prompts; save deep personal stories for trusted offsites.
              </li>
              <li>
                In hybrid rooms, design for remote first so in-room voices do not dominate.
