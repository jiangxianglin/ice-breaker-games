              knot-style icebreakers. The goal is clear communication, not speed. If you need a
              non-contact option or want to sit this round out, tell me and I will give you an

          <section className={styles.safety}>
            <h2>Facilitator notes &amp; safety</h2>
            <p>
              Physical teamwork only works when people feel free to opt out. Use these notes whenever
              you run the Human Knot or any close substitute.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                State consent upfront: holding hands or linking arms is optional; offer ropes, soft
                connectors, or observer roles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check space and mobility before starting—crowded rooms and unresolved accessibility
                needs are signals to pick a non-contact alternative.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep groups small enough to move safely (often under 16 per knot) and stop the round
                if anyone looks uncomfortable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Debrief collaboration and communication, not speed or “winning,” so competitive
                pressure does not embarrass quieter participants.

            <h2>How to choose among games like the Human Knot</h2>
            <p>
              Pick by contact level first. If the group is comfortable with movement and light
              physical teamwork, the classic knot, Train Wreck, or Chainlink can create fast energy.
              If you want the same collaboration lesson with less contact, use Marshmallow Challenge,
              Telephone Charades, Line-Up, or Common Ground as Human Knot substitutes.
