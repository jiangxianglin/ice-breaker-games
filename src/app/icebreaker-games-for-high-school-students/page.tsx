            <p>
              High school periods are short and socially complex. A well-scoped game beats an open-ended share circle for most first days and club meetings.

              Ice breaker games for high school students only work when students feel free to opt
              out and nobody is set up to be embarrassed in front of peers.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                State a pass option upfront and offer alternate roles for anyone who wants lower
                visibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use clean, school-safe prompts—skip dating, alcohol, body image, and private family
                topics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Watch for cliques excluding newcomers; mix groups with Find Your Match or Human
                Bingo before group projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adapt physical games for comfort and mobility; offer seated or non-contact variants
                without calling anyone out.
