              Remote icebreakers fail when they force camera performance. Design for chat-first
              inclusion and clear time boxes.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>State a pass option and celebrate chat answers equally with spoken ones.</li>
              <li>
                Prefer simultaneous formats for large groups so people are not trapped in long
                unmute queues.

                Pre-screen prompts for politics, body jokes, dating, and anything that could single

              <li>
                If energy gets chaotic, land the plane: thank the room and open the agenda while
                people are still smiling.
