            <p>
              Teens read social risk quickly. The right opener lowers that risk without putting anyone on a spotlight they did not choose.

              Icebreakers for teens only work when students feel free to opt out and nobody is set
              up to be embarrassed in front of peers.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Match the first game to the shyest person in the room—then raise energy if the
                group wants it.
              </li>
              <li>
                State a pass option upfront and offer alternate roles for anyone who wants lower
                visibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use clean, age-appropriate prompts—skip dating, alcohol, body image, and private
                family topics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adapt physical games for comfort and mobility; offer seated or non-contact variants
                without calling anyone out.
