            <p>
              Shared laughter lowers tension faster than forced small talk—if nobody becomes the punchline.

              <p>
                Funny meeting openers land when the humor targets shared situations—not people—and when the round stays short enough that laughter hands off to the agenda.

              Funny icebreakers fail when the humor targets people. Aim the jokes at situations,
              tools, and shared workplace absurdity.

              <li>State a pass option and celebrate chat answers equally with spoken ones.</li>

                Pre-screen prompts for politics, body jokes, dating, and anything that could
                single someone out.

              <li>Time-box tightly—funny openers lose goodwill when they run long.</li>

                If energy gets chaotic, land the plane: thank the room and open the agenda while
                people are still smiling.
