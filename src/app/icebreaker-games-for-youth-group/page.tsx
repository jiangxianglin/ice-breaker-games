              “Tonight we are going to play a short icebreaker so everyone gets a chance to meet
              someone new. You can pass anytime. The goal is connection, not perfection. If you need
              a different role—scorekeeper, timer, or photographer—tell a leader and we will set you
              up.”

            <h2>Facilitator notes &amp; safety</h2>
            <p>
              Youth group icebreakers only work when students feel free to opt out and nobody is set
              up to be embarrassed. Use these notes every night.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                State a pass option upfront and offer alternate roles (timer, photographer,
                scorekeeper) for anyone who wants lower visibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use clean, age-appropriate prompts—skip dating, alcohol, body image, and private
                family topics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Watch for cliques excluding newcomers; mix groups with Find Your Match or Human Bingo
                before deeper discussion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adapt physical games for comfort and mobility; offer seated or non-contact variants
                without calling anyone out.
              </li>
