            <h2>Why riddle icebreakers work on Zoom</h2>
            <p>
              Remote meetings lose the informal hallway energy that helps people settle in.
              Short, low-stakes puzzles restore shared attention without turning the call into
              a long go-around.
            </p>
            <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
              <p>
                Structured, time-boxed openers help remote teams recreate the connection that no
                longer happens in hallways—without forcing long personal monologues.

              just a curious puzzle we solve together. Type in chat if you prefer not to
              unmute. Wrong answers are welcome; they often make the best stories. Ready?

            <p>
              Virtual riddle icebreakers only work when people feel safe to guess wrong
              and to pass.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Publish prompts in chat for screen-reader users and anyone joining late.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid riddles that rely on local slang, insider jokes, or culture-only
                knowledge unless you explain the context.
              </li>
              <li>
                Never force camera-on participation; chat and reaction answers count.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stop after a few rounds while energy is still high—short beats clever.

            <h2>How to choose riddle icebreakers for virtual meetings</h2>
            <p>
              If your call has more than 20 people, start with Chat Waterfall or emoji
              decoding so everyone can answer at once. For smaller teams, Guess Who,
              Mystery Envelope, or Virtual Background Story create richer conversation.
              Save drawing and charades for socials or creative workshops where people
              already feel warmed up.
